I have developed a web application similar to the well-known sports media platform, The Athletic. This project is designed to provide users with a seamless experience in reading sports articles and posts while enabling content creators and administrators to manage the platform efficiently.

## Technology Stack:

### 1. Latest Articles & Posts Section
- Users can explore the latest sports articles and posts published on the platform.

### 2. Filters & Sorting
- Users can filter and sort content by author and league, ensuring a more personalized experience.

### 3. Search Functionality
- A powerful search feature allows users to find articles and posts across the site efficiently.

### 4. Admin Panel
- Full content management system (CMS) for site administrators.
- Create, edit, and delete key entities such as articles, posts, leagues, and authors.
- User management capabilities to oversee content contributors.

### 5. Author Mode
- Registered authors can create and manage their own articles and posts.
- Editing and publishing tools for a seamless writing experience.

## Additional Highlights:
- Responsive design for an optimal experience across devices.
- Secure authentication system for users, authors, and admins.
