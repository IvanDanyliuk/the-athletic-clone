- Users can filter and sort content by author and league, ensuring a more personalized experience.

### 3. Search Functionality
- A powerful search feature allows users to find articles and posts across the site efficiently.

### 4. Admin Panel

- Create, edit, and delete key entities such as articles, posts, leagues, and authors.
- User management capabilities to oversee content contributors.

### 5. Author Mode

- Editing and publishing tools for a seamless writing experience.

## Additional Highlights:
